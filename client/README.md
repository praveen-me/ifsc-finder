# React Boilerplate
This is a simple boilerplate for simple usecase. I created this because whenever I have start a project I have to `npx create-react-app`. This boilerplate includes necessary packages.

## How to start with boilerplate
* Just clone the boilerplate using `git clone https://github.com/praveen-me/simple-react-boilerplate.git`.
* Go to the directory using `cd simple-react-boilerplate`.
* Rename the directory using `mv simple-react-boilerplate __new-directory-name__`.
* Run `npm i` and then `npm start` to get started with project.

## Package Installed.
* eslint configure (airbnb style guide)
* redux
* react-redux
* react-router-dom
* node-sass
* redux-thunk
